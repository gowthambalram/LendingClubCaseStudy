## Project Overview
- The project aims to understand the dynamics of loan defaults and assess risk factors associated with borrowers.
- We explore various aspects of the loan data, including income levels, employment history, loan amounts, interest rates, and more, to identify patterns and trends that predict loan performance.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of loan data from a leading financial institution, including information on borrower demographics, financial behavior, and loan characteristics.
- Key attributes include loan amount, interest rate, employment length, home ownership status, annual income, and loan outcome.

## Analysis Summary
- Detailed explorations of income distribution, loan amounts, default rates, and other variables were conducted.
- Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to illustrate relationships and trends within the data.
- Insights include the impact of income levels on loan amounts, the correlation between interest rates and default rates, and the influence of employment stability on loan performance.

## Conclusions
1. **Income Distribution Among Borrowers**: Shows most borrowers earn under $100,000, highlighting a middle-income customer base.
2. **Default Loans Distribution by Interest Rate Segments**: Higher default rates in higher interest brackets, especially above 10%.
3. **Insight for 'Default Loans Distribution by Open Credit Lines Segments':** Applicants with number of open credit lines between 5 and 10 tend to show an increasing trend in default rates.
4. **Average Loan Amount by Income Bracket and State**: Heatmap showing higher income brackets typically receive larger loans across different states.
5. **Employment Length Distribution by State**: Heatmap showing diverse employment stability across states and its impact on loan performance.
6. **Default Rate by Issue Year**: Line chart tracking fluctuations in default rates over years, reflecting economic conditions or lending changes.
7. **Default Rate by Loan Grade**: Bar chart showing higher default rates in higher grades, affirming higher risk.
8. **Default Rate by Loan Sub Grade**: Bar chart shows higher default rates in the sub grades of F and G, affirming higher risk.
9. **Loan Amount vs. Annual Income**: Scatter plot showing positive correlation between income and loan amounts.
10. **Average Loan Amount & Interest Rate Distribution by Year**: Line chart indicating a general increase in loan amounts over time.
11. **Default Rate by Employment Length**: Shows that longer employment does not necessarily correlate with lower default rates.
12. **Default Rates by State**: Bar chart identifying states with higher financial risk based on default rates.
13. **Financial Maturity and Default Trends**: Bar chart showing lower default rates among borrowers with longer credit histories.
14. **Default Rate by Financial Maturity**: Bar chart indicating that longer financial maturity correlates with lower default rates.
15. **Income vs. Loan Amount**: Scatter plot supporting that higher incomes correlate with larger loan amounts.
