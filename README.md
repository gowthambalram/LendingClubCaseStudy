## Project Overview
- The project aims to understand the dynamics of loan defaults and assess risk factors associated with borrowers.
- We explore various aspects of the loan data, including income levels, employment history, loan amounts, interest rates, and more, to identify patterns and trends that predict loan performance.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of loan data from a leading financial institution, including information on borrower demographics, financial behavior, and loan characteristics.
- Key attributes include loan amount, interest rate, employment length, home ownership status, annual income, and loan outcome.

## Analysis Summary
- Detailed explorations of income distribution, loan amounts, default rates, and other variables were conducted.
- Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to illustrate relationships and trends within the data.
- Insights include the impact of income levels on loan amounts, the correlation between interest rates and default rates, and the influence of employment stability on loan performance.

## Conclusions
- Higher loan amounts and interest rates are strongly correlated with increased default rates.
- Borrowers with longer employment history do not necessarily exhibit lower default rates, challenging common lending assumptions.
- States with higher average loan amounts often exhibit higher default rates, indicating regional risk factors that need to be considered.
